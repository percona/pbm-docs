Percona Backup for MongoDB is a distributed, low-impact solution for consistent backups of MongoDB sharded clusters and replica sets. This is a tool for creating consistent backups across a MongoDB sharded cluster (or a non-sharded replica set), and for restoring
those backups to a specific point in time. 

Release Highlights
=====================

* Fixed the restore failure on a different cluster. Now the UUID of users and system collections are not preserved when replaying the oplog. 
* The PITR chunks display is now consistent in both `pbm status` and `pbm list` outputs. 


Bugs Fixed
================================================================================

* :jirabug:`PBM-871`: Fix replaying oplog on system collections during the restore (Thanks to Daniel Oliver for reporting this issue)
* :jirabug:`PBM-881`: Correct the display of PITR chunks for `pbm status` output
