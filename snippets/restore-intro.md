To restore a backup, use the [`pbm restore`](../reference/pbm-commands.md#pbm-restore) command supplying the backup name from which you intend to restore. Percona Backup for MongoDB identifies the type of the backup (physical, logical or [incremental](../features/incremental-backup.md)) and restores the database up to the [restore_to_time](../reference/glossary.md#completion-time) timestamp (available in `pbm list` output starting with version 1.4.0).
