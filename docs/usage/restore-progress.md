# View restore progress

!!! admonition "Version added: [2.0.0](../release-notes/2.0.0.md)"

You can track the status of both physical and logical restores. This gives you a clear understanding of the restore progress so that you can react accordingly. 

To view the restore status, run the `pbm describe-restore` command and specify the restore name. To track the progress of a physical restore, also specify the path to the Percona Backup for MongoDB configuration file. Since `mongod` nodes are shut down during a physical restore, Percona Backup for MongoDB uses the configuration file to read the restore status on storage.

```{.bash data-prompt="$"}
$ pbm describe-restore 2022-08-15T11:14:55.683148162Z -c pbm_config.yaml
```

The output provides the following information:

-  Restore name
-  The name of the backup from which the database was restored
-  Type
-  Status
-  opID
-  The time of the restore start
-  Last transition time â€“ the time when the restore process changed its status
-  The name of every replica set, its restore status and the last transition time 

For physical backups only, the following additional information is provided:

- The node name
- Restore status on the node
- Last transition time

Refer to the [pbm describe-restore](../reference/pbm-commands.md#output_1) for the full list of fields and their description.

For version 1.8.1 and earlier, tracking restore progress during physical restores is not available. To check the restore status, the options are:

- Check the `stderr` logs of the leader `pbm-agent`. The leader ID is printed once the restore has started.
- Check the status in the metadata file created on the remote storage for the restore. This file is in the root of the storage path and has the format `.pbm.restore/<restore_timestamp>.json`.
