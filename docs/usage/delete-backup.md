# Delete backups

To limit the amount of space for old backups on the backup storage, you need to delete these backups periodically. You can do this in the following ways:

- [delete backup snapshots and point-in-time recovery oplog slices simultaneously](#clean-up-outdated-data). This way you can [automate storage cleanup](schedule-backup.md#backup-storage-cleanup). 
- [delete backup snapshots](#delete-backup-snapshots) and [point-in-time oplog slices](#delete-oplog-slices) separately. This gives you more control over the deletion flow. However, these are manual operations.  


## Clean up outdated data

!!! admonition "Version added: [2.1.0](../release-notes/2.1.0.md)"

To delete both outdated backup snapshots and point-in-time recovery oplog slices, use the [`pbm cleanup --older-than`](../reference/pbm-commands.md#pbm-cleanup) command. This simplifies the [automation of the backup rotation](schedule-backup.md#backup-storage-cleanup).

The timestamp you specify for the `--older-than` flag must be in the following format:

* `%Y-%M-%DT%H:%M:%S` (for example, 2023-04-20T13:13:20) or
* `%Y-%M-%D` (2023-04-20)
* `XXd` (1d or 30d). Only days are supported.

During the cleanup, you see the backups and oplog slices to be deleted and are asked to confirm the action. To bypass it, add the `--yes` flag:

```{.bash data-prompt="$"}
$ pbm cleanup --older-than=`%Y-%M-%D --yes
```

### Behavior

The timestamp you specify is considered to be the time to which you would wish to restore. Therefore, PBM doesn’t delete all backup snapshots and oplog slices that could be used to restore to this time.

Here's how the cleanup works:

* **Physical and selective backups** are deleted up to the specified time.
* **Incremental physical backups** are deleted up to the specified time if the timestamp doesn't fall within the backup chain. If it does, PBM checks for the most recent base incremental backup in relation to the specified timestamp. PBM keeps this backup and the whole chain deriving from it to ensure the potential restore.

    For example, you have the following list of backups:
    
    ```{.bash .no-copy}
    Snapshots:
        2023-04-14T19:34:52Z 520.86MB <incremental> [restore_to_time: 2023-04-14T19:34:54Z]
        2023-04-14T08:12:50Z 576.63MB <incremental, base> [restore_to_time: 2023-04-14T08:12:52Z]
        2023-04-12T03:02:08Z 498.50MB <incremental> [restore_to_time: 2023-04-12T03:02:10Z]
        2023-04-11T19:30:14Z 552.77MB <incremental, base> [restore_to_time: 2023-04-11T19:30:16Z]
        2023-04-11T14:25:51Z 572.41MB <physical> [restore_to_time: 2023-04-11T14:25:54Z]
    ```

    You wish to delete all backups that are older than 2023-04-14T15:00:00

    ```{.bash .no-copy}
    $ pbm cleanup --older-than="2023-04-14T15:00:00"
    ```

    This timestamp falls inside the backup chain that starts with the `2023-04-14T08:12:50Z` backup. That’s why PBM keeps this backup and the incremental backup chain deriving from it and deletes all data that is older than this backup.

    Output:

    ```{.bash .no-copy} 
    S3 us-east-1 s3://http://192.168.56.1:9000/bcp/pbme2etest
      Snapshots:
        2023-04-14T19:34:52Z 520.86MB <incremental> [restore_to_time: 2023-04-14T19:34:54Z]
        2023-04-14T08:12:50Z 576.63MB <incremental, base> [restore_to_time: 2023-04-14T08:12:52Z]
    ```
   
* **Logical backup** cleanup also depends on the point-in-time recovery settings. 

    * By default, PBM looks for the most recent backup in relation to the specified timestamp and deletes all logical backups and oplog slices up to the backup’s `restore_to_time` value.  

       To illustrate, let's say you have the following backup list:

       ```{.bash .no-copy}
       Snapshots:
           2023-04-13T13:26:58Z 147.29MB <logical> [restore_to_time: 2023-04-13T13:27:15Z]
           2023-04-13T10:12:08Z 147.29MB <logical> [restore_to_time: 2023-04-13T10:12:27Z]
           2023-04-13T08:48:32Z 147.28MB <logical> [restore_to_time: 2023-04-13T08:48:51Z]
         PITR chunks [2.11MB]:
           2023-04-13T08:48:52Z - 2023-04-13T13:27:15Z
       ```

       You wish to delete all data up to 2023-04-13T12:00:00.

       The most recent backup in relation to this timestamp is `2023-04-13T10:12:08Z 147.29MB`. So PBM deletes all backups that are older than this backup. It also deletes all oplog slices up to the backup’s `restore_to_time: 2023-04-13T10:12:27Z`. The output after the cleanup looks like this:

       ```{.bash .no-copy}
       Snapshots:
           2023-04-13T13:26:58Z 147.29MB <logical> [restore_to_time: 2023-04-13T13:27:15Z]
           2023-04-13T10:12:08Z 147.29MB <logical> [restore_to_time: 2023-04-13T10:12:27Z]
         PITR chunks [157.94KB]:
           2023-04-13T10:12:28Z - 2023-04-13T13:27:46Z
       ```

    * When point-in-time recovery is enabled and you specify the timestamp greater than the `restore_to_time` for the most recent logical backup, PBM keeps this backup and all oplog slices deriving from it to ensure point-in-time recovery. 
    * When the specified timestamp equals to the `restore_to_time` value for any full logical, physical and base incremental backups, PBM deletes all logical backup snapshots and oplog slices up to this backup’s `restore_to_time`.

## Delete backup snapshots

### Considerations

1. You can only delete a backup that is not running (has the “done” or the “error” state). To check the backup state, run the [`pbm status`](../reference/pbm-commands.md#pbm-status) command.

2. To ensure oplog continuity for [point-in-time restore](pitr-tutorial.md), the `pbm delete-backup` command deletes any backup(s) except the following:

    * A backup snapshot that can serve as the base for any point-in-time recovery and has point-in-time recovery time ranges deriving from it. To delete such a backup, first [delete the oplog slices](#delete-oplog-slices) that are created  after the `restore-to time` value for this backup.

    * The most recent backup if point-in-time recovery is enabled and there are no oplog slices following this backup yet.

    To illustrate this, let’s take the following `pbm list` output:

    ```{.bash .no-copy}
    Backup snapshots:
      2022-10-05T14:13:50Z <logical> [restore_to_time: 2022-10-05T14:13:55Z]
      2022-10-06T14:52:42Z <logical> [restore_to_time: 2022-10-06T14:52:47Z]
      2022-10-07T14:57:17Z <logical> [restore_to_time: 2022-10-07T14:57:22Z]

    PITR <on>:
      2022-10-05T14:13:56Z - 2022-10-05T18:52:21Z
    ```

    You can delete a backup `2022-10-06T14:52:42Z` since it has no point-in-time oplog slices. You cannot delete the following backups:

    - `2022-10-05T14:13:50Z` because it is the base for recovery to any point in time from the PITR time range `2022-10-05T14:13:56Z - 2022-10-05T18:52:21Z`
    - `2022-10-07T14:57:17Z` because PITR is enabled and there are no oplog slices following it yet.

### Behavior

You can delete either a specified backup snapshot or backup snapshots created before the specified time. Starting with version 2.0.0, you can delete [selective backups](../features/selective-backup.md). Starting with version [2.4.0](../release-notes/2.4.0.md), you can delete backups by type; for example, delete all physical backups that are older than the specified time.

=== "A specific backup"

     To delete a backup, specify the `<backup_name>` as an argument.

     ```{.bash data-prompt="$"}
     $ pbm delete-backup <backup_name>
     ```

=== "Backups older than the specified time"
    
    To delete backups that were created before the specified time, pass the `--older-than` flag to the `pbm delete-backup` command. Specify the timestamp as an argument for `pbm delete-backup` in the following format:

    * `%Y-%M-%DT%H:%M:%S` (for example, 2021-04-20T13:13:20Z) or
    * `%Y-%M-%D` (2021-04-20).

    #### Example

    View backups:

    ```{.bash data-prompt="$"}
    $ pbm list
    ```

    **Output**:

    ```{.text .no-copy}
    Backup snapshots:
      2021-04-20T20:55:42Z
      2021-04-20T23:47:34Z
      2021-04-20T23:53:20Z
      2021-04-21T02:16:33Z
    ```

    Delete backups created before the specified timestamp

    ```{.bash data-prompt="$"}
    pbm delete-backup -f --older-than 2021-04-21
    ```

    **Output**:

    ```{.text .no-copy}
    Backup snapshots:
      2021-04-21T02:16:33Z
    ```

=== "Specific types of backups"

    To delete backups of a specific type that were created before the specified time, run the `pbm delete backup` with the `--type` and the `--older-than` flags. Note that you must specify both flags to delete backups of the desired type.

    You can delete several types of backups, for example, logical and selective, by passing comma-separated values for the `--type` flag.

    PBM deletes all backups that don't serve as the base for restore to the specified timestamp.

    #### Example

    You have the following list of backups:



By default, the ``pbm delete-backup`` command asks for your confirmation to proceed with the deletion. To bypass it, add the `-f` or
 `--force` flag.

 ```{.bash data-prompt="$"}
 $ pbm delete-backup --force 2021-04-20T13:45:59Z
 ```

!!! admonition ""

    For Percona Backup for MongoDB 1.5.0 and earlier versions, when you delete a backup, all oplog slices that relate to this backup are deleted too. For example, you delete a backup snapshot `2020-07-24T18:13:09` while there is another snapshot `2020-08-05T04:27:55` created after it.  The **pbm-agent** deletes only oplog slices that relate to `2020-07-24T18:13:09`.

    The same applies if you delete backups older than the specified time.

    Note that when point-in-time recovery is enabled, the most recent backup snapshot and oplog slices that relate to it are not deleted.

## Delete oplog slices

!!! admonition "Version added: [1.6.0](../release-notes/1.6.0.md)"

You can delete oplog slices saved before the specified time or all slices altogether. By deleting old and/or unnecessary slices, you can save storage space. 

### Behavior

To view oplog slices, run the [`pbm list`](../reference/pbm-commands.md#pbm-list) command. If you have [deleted the snapshot](#delete-backup-snapshots) and want to delete the respective oplog slices, run the `pbm list --unbacked` command to view them.

=== "Delete all oplog slices"

    Run the `pbm delete-pitr` and pass the `--all` flag:

    ```{.bash data-prompt="$"}
    $ pbm delete-pitr --all
    ```

=== "Earlier than the specified timestamp" 
    
    To delete slices that are made earlier than the specified time, run the `pbm delete-pitr` command with the `--older-than` flag and pass the timestamp for it. The timestamp must be in the following format:

    * `%Y-%M-%DT%H:%M:%S` (for example, 2021-07-20T10:01:18) or
    * `%Y-%M-%D` (2021-07-20).

    ```{.bash data-prompt="$"}
    $ pbm delete-pitr --older-than 2021-07-20T10:01:18
    ```

To enable [point-in-time recovery](pitr-tutorial.md) from the most recent backup snapshot, Percona Backup for MongoDB does not delete slices that were made after that snapshot. For example, if the most recent snapshot is `2021-07-20T07:05:23Z [restore_to_time: 2021-07-21T07:05:44]` and you specify the timestamp `2021-07-20T07:05:44`, Percona Backup for MongoDB deletes only slices that were made before `2021-07-20T07:05:23Z`.

To verify what oplog slices will be deleted without yet deleting them, run the ``pbm delete-pitr`` command with the `--dry-run` flag.
