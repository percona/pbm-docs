# Percona Backup for MongoDB status

!!! admonition "Version added: [1.4.0](../release-notes/1.4.0.md)"

You can check the status of Percona Backup for MongoDB running in your MongoDB environment using the [`pbm status`](../reference/pbm-commands.md#pbm-status) command.

```{.bash data-prompt="$"}
$ pbm status
```

The output provides the information about:

* Your MongoDB deployment and `pbm-agents` running in it: to what `mongod` node each agent is connected, the Percona Backup for MongoDB version it runs and the agentâ€™s state

* The currently running backups / restores, if any

* Backups stored in the remote backup storage: backup name, completion time, size and status (complete, canceled, failed)

* [Point-in-time recovery](../features/point-in-time-recovery.md) status (enabled or disabled)

* Valid time ranges for point-in-time recovery and the data size

This simplifies troubleshooting since the whole information is provided in one place.
