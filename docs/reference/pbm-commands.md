# `pbm` commands

`pbm` CLI is the command line utility to control the backup system. This page describes `pbm` commands available in Percona Backup for MongoDB.

For how to get started with Percona Backup for MongoDB, see [Initial setup](../install/initial-setup.md).

## pbm backup

Creates a backup snapshot and saves it in the remote backup storage.

The command has the following syntax:

```{.bash data-prompt="$"}
$ pbm backup [<flags>]
```

For more information about using `pbm backup`, see [Starting a backup](../usage/start-backup.md)

The command accepts the following flags:

| Flag           | Description                                           |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `-t`, `--type` | The type of backup. Supported values: physical, logical (default), incremental, [external](../features/snapshots.md). When not specified, Percona Backup for MongoDB makes a logical backup. |
| `--base`       | For incremental backups only. Set the backup as the base and start tracking the incremental backup history to calculate and save the difference in data blocks for subsequent incremental backups. |  
| `--compression`| Create a backup with compression. <br> Supported compression methods: `gzip`, `snappy`, `lz4`, `s2`, `pgzip`, `zstd`. Default: `s2` <br> The `none` value means no compression is done during backup. |
| `--compression-level` | Configure the compression level from 0 to 10. The default value depends on the compression method used.  |
| `-o`, `--out=text`    | Shows the output format as either plain text or a JSON object. Supported values: `text`, `json` |
| `--wait`       | Wait for the backup to finish. The flag blocks the shell session.|
| `-l`, `--list-files` | For external backups only. Shows the list of files per node to copy.|
| `--ns="database.collection"`| Makes a logical backup of the specified namespace - the database and collection(s). To back up all collections in the database, specify the value in the `--ns="database.*"` format. In version 2.0.0, only a single namespace is supported for the backup.|

??? "JSON output"

    ```json
    {
      "name": "<backup_name>",
      "storage": "<my-backup-dir>"
    }

The command has the following syntax:

```{.bash data-prompt="$"}
pbm cleanup [<flags>]
```

The command accepts the following flags:

| Flag                     | Description               |

## pbm delete-backup

Deletes the specified backup snapshot or all backup snapshots that are older than the specified time with the option to filter by specific type. The command deletes backups that are not running regardless of the remote backup storage being used.

The following is the command syntax:

```{.bash data-prompt="$"}
$ pbm delete-backup [<flags>] [<name>]
```

The command accepts the following flags:

| Flag                     | Description             |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| `--older-than=TIMESTAMP` | Deletes backups older than date / time specified in the format:<br> - `%Y-%M-%DT%H:%M:%S` (e.g. 2023-04-20T13:13:20) or <br> - `%Y-%M-%D` (e.g. 2023-04-20)|
| `--type=TYPE`           | Deletes backups of the specified type. Must be used together with the `-older-than` flag. Available starting with version 2.4.0|
| `--force`                | Forcibly deletes backups without asking for user's confirmation. Deprecated. Use the `--yes` flag instead. |
| `-y`, `--yes`            | Deletes backups without asking for user's confirmation |
| `--dry-run`              | Prints the list of backup snapshots to be deleted without deleting them. You can use the flag to check what exactly will be deleted. Available starting with version 2.4.0. | 

## pbm delete-pitr

Deletes oplog slices produced for Point-in-Time Recovery.

The command has the following syntax:

```{.bash data-prompt="$"}
pbm delete-pitr [<flags>]
```

The command accepts the following flags:

| Flag                     | Description               |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| `-a`, `--all`            | Deletes all oplog slices. Deprecated. Use the `--older-than flag instead`  |
| `--older-than=TIMESTAMP` | Deletes oplog slices older than date / time specified in the format: <br> - `%Y-%M-%DT%H:%M:%S` (e.g. 2020-04-20T13:13:20) or <br> - `%Y-%M-%D` (e.g. 2020-04-20) <br><br> When you specify a timestamp, Percona Backup for MongoDB rounds it down to align with the completion time of the closest backup snapshot and deletes oplog slices that precede this time. Thus, extra slices remain. This is done to ensure oplog continuity. To illustrate, the PITR time range is `2021-08-11T11:16:21 - 2021-08-12T08:55:25` and backup snapshots are: <br><br> `2021-08-12T08:49:46Z 13.49MB [restore_to_time: 2021-08-12T08:50:06]` <br> `2021-08-11T11:36:17Z 7.37MB [restore_to_time: 2021-08-11T11:36:38]`<br> <br> Say you specify the timestamp `2021-08-11T19:16:21`. The closest backup is `2021-08-11T11:36:17Z 7.37KB [restore_to_time: 2021-08-11T11:36:38]`. PBM rounds down the timestamp to `2021-08-11T11:36:38` and deletes all slices that precede this time. As a result, your PITR time range is `2021-08-11T11:36:38 - 2021-08-12T09:00:25`. <br><br> **NOTE**: Percona Backup for MongoDB doesn’t delete the oplog slices that follow the most recent backup. This is done to ensure point in time recovery from that backup snapshot. For example, if the snapshot is `2021-07-20T07:05:23Z [restore_to_time: 2021-07-21T07:05:44]` and you specify the timestamp `2021-07-20T07:05:45`, Percona Backup for MongoDB deletes only slices that were made before `2021-07-20T07:05:23Z`.|
| `--force`                | Forcibly deletes oplog slices without asking a user’s confirmation. Deprecated. Use the `-y`/`--yes` flag instead.  |
| `-o`, `--out=json`       | Shows the output as either the plain text (default) or a JSON object. Supported values: `text`, `json`.   |
| `--yes`                  | Deletes backups without asking for user's confirmation |
| `--dry-run`              | Prints the list of oplog slices to be deleted without deleting them. You can use the flag to check what exactly will be deleted. Available starting with version 2.4.0. | 
| `-w`, `--wait`          | Wait for the deletion operation to complete. |

## pbm help

Returns the help information about `pbm` commands.

## pbm list

Provides the list of backups. In versions 1.3.4 and earlier, the command lists all backups and their states. Backup states are the following:

* In progress - A backup is running
* Canceled - A backup was canceled
* Error - A backup was finished with an error
* No status means a backup is complete

As of version 1.4.0, only successfully completed backups are listed. To view currently information about a running or a failed backup, run [`pbm status`](#pbm-status).

When Point-in-Time Recovery is enabled, the `pbm list` also provides the list of valid time ranges for recovery and point-in-time recovery status.

The command has the following syntax:

```{.bash data-prompt="$"}
$ pbm list [<flags>]
```

The command accepts the following flags:

| Flag                | Description                      |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `--restore`         | Shows last N restores. Starting with version 2.0, the output shows restore names instead of backup names, as multiple restores can be done from a single backup.           |
| `--size=0`          | Shows last N backups.  It also provides the information whether the restore is a selective one.         |
| `-o`, `--out=text`  | Shows the output format as either plain text or a JSON object. Supported values: `text`, `json`                 |
| `--unbacked`        | Shows Point-in-Time Recovery oplog slices that were saved without the base backup snapshot. Available starting with version 1.8.0.|

| `end=timestamp`         | The end time for the oplog replay.   |
| `--replset-remapping`   | Maps the replica set names for the oplog replay. The value format is `to_name_1=from_name_1,to_name_2=from_name_2`. |


## pbm restore

Restores database from a specified backup / to a specified point in time. Depending on the backup type, makes either logical, physical, or a snapshot-based restore.

The command has the following syntax:

```{.bash data-prompt="$"}
$ pbm restore [<flags>] [<backup_name>]
```

For more information about using `pbm restore`, see [Restoring a backup](../usage/restore.md).

The command accepts the following flags:

| Flag                | Description                           |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `--external`        | Indicates the backup as the one made outside PBM (for example, snapshot-based)       |
| `--time=TIME`       | Restores the database to the specified point in time. Available for logical restores and if [Point-in-time recovery](../features/point-in-time-recovery.md) is enabled. |
| `-w`                | Wait for the restore to finish. The flag blocks the shell session. |
| `-o`, `--out=text`  | Shows the output format as either plain text or a JSON object. Supported values: `text`, `json` |
| `--base-snapshot`   | Restores the database from a specified backup to the specified point in time. Without this flag, the most recent backup preceding the timestamp is used for point in recovery. Available in Percona Backup for MongoDB starting from version 1.6.0.<br><br> In version 2.3.0, this flag is optional for [point-in-time recovery from physical backups](../usage/pitr-tutorial.md#from-physical-backups). <br><br> In version 2.2.0, this flag is mandatory for making a [point-in-time recovery from physical backups](../usage/pitr-tutorial.md#from-physical-backups). Without it, PBM looks for a logical backup to restore from.|
| `--replset-remapping`| Maps the replica set names for the data restore / oplog replay. The value format is `to_name_1=from_name_1,to_name_2=from_name_2`|
| `--ns="database.collection"`| Restores the specified namespace(s) - databases and collections. To restore all collections in the database, specify the values as `--ns="database.*"`. The `--ns` flag accepts several namespaces as the comma-separated list. For example, ns="db1.*,db2.coll2,db3.coll1,db3.collX"|
| `-c`, `--config`     | The path to the `mongod.conf` file

## pbm restore-finish

Instructs PBM to complete the snapshot-based physical restore. Must be run after running `pbm restore --external`. To learn more, refer to [API for snapshot-based physical backups](../features/snapshots.md).

The command has the following syntax:

```{.bash data-prompt="$"}
$ pbm restore-finish <restore_name> [flags]
```

The command accepts the following flags:

| Flag                | Description                           |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `-c`                | The path to the PBM configuration file. Required to complete the restore.|
