# Quickstart guide

Percona Backup for MongoDB (PBM) is an open source and distributed solution for consistent backups and restore of [MongoDB sharded clusters and replica sets](details/deployments.md). [Learn how PBM works](intro.md).

Find the list of supported platforms for Percona Backup for MongoDB on the [Percona Software and Platform Lifecycle :octicons-link-external-16:](https://www.percona.com/services/policies/percona-software-platform-lifecycle#mongodb) page.

## System requirements

* At least 1GB RAM is required on every node for `pbm-agents` to operate successfully.
* All `pbm-agents` in the cluster must be able to connect to all config server replica set nodes that could become a new primary. In non-sharded replica set deployments, this means to connect to all the nodes that could become a new primary node. To become a primary, a node must meet the following criteria:

    * have `priority` greater than `0` and must be able to vote (`votes`: 1)
    * is not an arbiter (`arbiterOnly: false`)
    * is not hidden (`hidden: false`)
    * is not delayed 

* All `pbm-agents` in your deployment must be able to connect to the same [remote backup storage](details/storage-configuration.md) using the same credentials.

Note that networking issues like connection to the remote backup storage can also affect PBM performance.
