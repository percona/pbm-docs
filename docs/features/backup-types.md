You can use several types of database backups and restores to develop your backup strategy.

Not sure what exactly backup you need? The following diagram helps you decide:

The following table provides an overview of each type:

| Type           | Version added |  When to use | Supported deployments | Percona Server for MongoDB | MongoDB Community /Enterprise Edition |
| ---------------| ------------ | ----------------------| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------| ----------| 
| [Logical](logical.md) <br><small>GA</small>|  1.0.0 | - Selective restore of a specific database or a collection in a cluster (starting with version 2.0.0) <br> - Resilient to major / minor version changes in MongoDB and can be used for migration <br> - Both MongoDB and PBM run in Docker| Sharded clusters and non-sharded replica sets | Yes | Yes | 
| [Physical](physical.md) <br><small>GA</small> |  2.0.0  | - Full restore of a very large (e.g. Terabytes of data) dataset to a specific point in time with guaranteed data consistency <br> - Faster restores compared to logical ones | Sharded clusters and non-sharded replica sets | Yes (starting with 4.2.15-16, 4.4.6-8 and higher, 5.0.x, 6.0.x and higher) | No | 
| [Selective](selective-backup.md) <br><small>[Tech preview](../reference/glossary.md#technical-preview-feature)</small> | 2.0.0  | Restore of the desired subset of data without disrupting the operations of your whole cluster| Sharded clusters starting with version 2.0.3. Sharded collections starting with version 2.1.0. | Yes | Yes | 
| [Incremental](incremental-backup.md) <br><small>GA</small> | 2.1.0 (For PSMDB versions 4.2.24-24, 4.4.18-18, 5.0.2-1, 6.0.2-1 and higher) | Save on disk space for large backups where the data needs to be frequently backed up | Sharded clusters and non-sharded replica sets | Yes  | No |  
| [Point-in-time recovery](point-in-time-recovery.md) <br><small>GA</small> | 1.3.0 (logical) <br> 2.0.0 (physical manually) <br> 2.2.0 (physical automated)  | Full restore of a database to a specific point in time with guaranteed data consistency | Sharded clusters and non-sharded replica sets | Yes | Yes |
| [Snapshot-based](snapshots.md) <br><small>[Tech preview](../reference/glossary.md#technical-preview-feature)</small> | 2.2.0 | Restore of a very  large data set (e.g. Terabytes of data) with almost immediate access to data. A drawback is no guarantee for data consistency in your cluster | Sharded clusters and non-sharded replica sets | Yes | No |
