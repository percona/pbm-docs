# AWS S3 storage

Percona Backup for MongoDB (PBM) works with AWS S3 and other S3-compatible storage services. We test PBM with the following services:

* [Amazon Simple Storage Service :octicons-link-external-16:](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/s3/index.html)
* [MinIO :octicons-link-external-16:](https://min.io/)

This document provides overview for the native AWS S3 services. To use MinIO and other S3-compatible storage services, see [S3-compatible storage](minio.md).

[Configuration example :material-arrow-down:](#configuration-example){.md-button}

## Storage bucket creation

To create a bucket, do the following.

1. Install and configure [AWS CLI :octicons-link-external-16:](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)

2. Create an S3 bucket

    ```{.bash data-prompt="$"}
    $ aws s3api create-bucket --bucket my-s3-bucket --region us-east-1
    ```
  
3. Verify the bucket creation

    ```{.bash data-prompt="$"}
    $ aws s3 ls
    ```

After the bucket is created, apply the proper [permissions for PBM to use the bucket](storage-configuration.md#permissions-setup).

## Configuration example

!!! important
    
    Percona Backup for MongoDB (PBM) needs its own dedicated S3 bucket exclusively for backup-related files. Ensure that this [bucket is created](#storage-bucket-creation) and managed solely by PBM.

This is the example for the basic configuration of AWS S3 storage in Percona Backup for MongoDB. You can find [the configuration file template :octicons-link-external-16:](https://github.com/percona/percona-backup-mongodb/blob/v{{release}}/packaging/conf/pbm-conf-reference.yml) and uncomment the required fields.


```yaml
storage:
  type: s3
  s3:
    region: us-west-2
    bucket: pbm-test-bucket
    prefix: data/pbm/backup
    credentials:
      access-key-id: <your-access-key-id-here>
      secret-access-key: <your-secret-key-here>
    serverSideEncryption:
      sseAlgorithm: aws:kms
      kmsKeyID: <your-kms-key-here>
```

For the description of configuration options, see [Configuration file options](../reference/configuration-options.md).

## Fine-tune storage configuration 

The following sections describe how you can fine-tune your storage configuration: 

* [server-side encryption](#server-side-encryption) 
* [debug logging](#debug-logging) 
* [storage classes](#storage-classes)
* [upload retries](#upload-retries) 
* [multiple endpoints to the same S3 storage](endpoint-map.md) 

### Server-side encryption

Percona Backup for MongoDB supports [server-side encryption](../reference/glossary.md#server-side-encryption) for [S3 buckets](../reference/glossary.md#bucket) with the following encryption types:

* [customer-provided keys stored in AWS KMS (SSE-KMS)](#using-aws-kms-keys-sse-kms)
* [customer-provided keys stored on the client side (SSE-C)](#using-customer-provided-keys-sse-c)
* [Amazon S3 managed encryption keys (SSE-S3)](#using-amazon-s3-managed-keys-sse-s3)

####  Using AWS KMS keys (SSE-KMS)

To use the SSE-KMS encryption, specify the following parameters in the Percona Backup for MongoDB configuration file: 

```yaml
serverSideEncryption:
   kmsKeyID: <kms_key_ID>
   sseAlgorithm: aws:kms
```  

#### Using customer-provided keys (SSE-C)

!!! admonition "Version added: [2.0.1](../release-notes/2.0.1.md)" 

Percona Backup for MongoDB also supports server-side encryption with customer-provided keys that are stored on the client side (SSE-C). Percona Backup for MongoDB provides the encryption keys as part of the requests to the S3 storage. The S3 storage uses them to encrypt/decrypt the data using the `AES-256` encryption algorithm. In such a way you save on subscribing to AWS KMS services and can use the server-side encryption with the S3-compatible storage of your choice.

!!! warning

    1. Enable/disable the server-side encryption only for the empty bucket. Otherwise, Percona Backup for MongoDB fails to save/retrieve objects to/from the storage properly.
    2. S3 storage doesn't manage or store the encryption key. It is your responsibility to track what key was used to encrypt what object in the bucket. If you lose the key, any request for an object without the encryption key fails and you lose the object. 

To use the SSE-C encryption, specify the following parameters in the Percona Backup for MongoDB configuration file:    

```yaml
serverSideEncryption:
  sseCustomerAlgorithm: AES256
  sseCustomerKey: <your_encryption_key>
``` 

#### Using Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3)

!!! admonition "Version added: [2.6.0](../release-notes/2.6.0.md)" 

Percona Backup for MongoDB supports server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3), the default encryption method in Amazon AWS S3. Amazon S3 encrypts each object with a unique key. As an additional safeguard, it encrypts the key itself with a key that it rotates regularly. Amazon S3 server-side encryption uses 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard Galois/Counter Mode (AES-GCM) to encrypt all uploaded objects.

To use SSE-S3 encryption, specify the following parameters in the Percona Backup for the MongoDB configuration file:

```yaml
serverSideEncryption:
   sseAlgorithm: AES256
```  

### Debug logging

You can enable debug logging for different types of S3 requests in Percona Backup for MongoDB. Percona Backup for MongoDB prints S3 log messages in the `pbm logs` output so that you can debug and diagnose S3 request issues or failures.

To enable S3 debug logging, set the `storage.s3.DebugLogLevel` option in Percona Backup for MongoDB configuration. The supported values are: `LogDebug`, `Signing`, `HTTPBody`, `RequestRetries`, `RequestErrors`, `EventStreamBody`.

### Storage classes 

Percona Backup for MongoDB supports [Amazon S3 storage classes :octicons-link-external-16:](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/). Knowing your data access patterns, you can set the S3 storage class in Percona Backup for MongoDB configuration. When Percona Backup for MongoDB uploads data to S3, the data is distributed to the corresponding storage class. The support of S3 bucket storage types allows you to effectively manage S3 storage space and costs.

To set the storage class, specify the `storage.s3.storageClass` option in Percona Backup for MongoDB configuration file:

```yaml
storage:
  type: s3
  s3:
    storageClass: INTELLIGENT_TIERING
```

When the option is undefined, the S3 Standard (`STANDARD`) storage type is used.

### Upload retries 

You can set up the number of attempts for Percona Backup for MongoDB to upload data to S3 storage as well as the min and max time to wait for the next retry. Set the options `storage.s3.retryer.numMaxRetries`, `storage.s3.retryer.minRetryDelay` and `storage.s3.retryer.maxRetryDelay` in Percona Backup for MongoDB configuration.

```yaml
retryer:
  numMaxRetries: 3
  minRetryDelay: 30
  maxRetryDelay: 5
```

This upload retry increases the chances of data upload completion in cases of unstable connection.
