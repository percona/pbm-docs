# Percona Backup for MongoDB documentation

Percona Backup for MongoDB (PBM) is an open source and distributed solution for consistent backups and restore of [MongoDB sharded clusters and replica sets](details/deployments.md). Read more [how PBM works](intro.md).

Make backups on a running server and restore your database to a specific point in time using the PBM command line interface. Alternatively, manage backups from a web interface [with PBM and Percona Monitoring and Management](https://docs.percona.com/percona-monitoring-and-management/get-started/backup/index.html).
