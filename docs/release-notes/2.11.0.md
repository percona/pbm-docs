# Percona Backup for MongoDB 2.11.0 ({{date.2_11_0}})

[Installation](../installation.md){.md-button}


Percona Backup for MongoDB is a distributed, low-impact solution for creating consistent backups of MongoDB sharded clusters and replica sets, and for restoring those backups to a specific point in time.

## Release Highlights

This release provides the following features and improvements:

## Ensure successful upload of any size backup

When backup files are so large that they exceed the object size limit for backup storage, PBM now splits such files into pieces that fall within the size limit and uploads them to the storage. PBM names these pieces to identify and manage them later. The reverse process occurs during the data read for a restore: PBM merges the pieces into a single file and proceeds with the command execution. You can redefine the default size limit using PBM configuration and ensure your backups are uploaded regardless of the storage. Learn more about how to do it in the [documentation](../features/split-merge-backup.md).

## Changelog

## Improvements

- [PBM-1490](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PBM-1490): Physical backups now automatically split and reassemble very large files, preventing failures when uploading to storage with size limits.
- [PBM-1562](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PBM-1562): Provided a complete Percona Backup for MongoDB configuration example for easier and more accurate setup.
- [PBM-1597](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PBM-1597): PBM now displays more specific error messages when your MongoDB version is incompatible, guiding you on whether to upgrade MongoDB or PBM.

## Fixed bugs

- [PBM-1497](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PBM-1497): Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR) now accurately reports failure when oplog replay encounters errors.
- [PBM-1569](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PBM-1569): The `pbm restore` command now displays a clear message when required arguments are missing, rather than a confusing parsing error.
- [PBM-1574](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PBM-1574): The `pbm restore -w` command now correctly waits until the entire restore process is complete.
- [PBM-1581](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PBM-1581): Security has been enhanced for services connecting with Google.
- [PBM-1583](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PBM-1583): PBM now keeps all routing collections in the target cluster and clears contents in all of them except the `config.system.sessions` collection during logical restores to avoid the "Time monotonicity violation" error
- [PBM-1591](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PBM-1591): Logical backups now complete successfully even when time series collections share the same name across different databases.
- [PBM-1604](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PBM-1604): PBM CLI now correctly waits for restore completion in single-node replica set setups without reporting false errors.
- [PBM-1605](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PBM-1605): Backups that fail to complete are now correctly marked as failures, preventing misleading successful statuses.
