# Percona Backup for MongoDB 2.1.0 (2023-04-18)

| Release date | April 18, 2023  |
|------------- | ---------------|
| Installation | [Installing Percona Backup for MongoDB](../installation.md) |


Percona Backup for MongoDB is a distributed, low-impact solution for consistent backups of MongoDB sharded clusters and replica sets. This is a tool for creating consistent backups across a MongoDB sharded cluster (or a non-sharded replica set), and for restoring those backups to a specific point in time.

## Release Highlights

* [Incremental physical backups](../features/incremental-backup.md) are now generally available enabling you to use them in production environments. Note that due to the changes in metadata files required for the restore, backups made with previous PBM versions are incompatible for the restore with PBM 2.1.0. 
* You can now [selectively back up and restore sharded collections](../features/selective-backup.md#sharded-collections). This improves the management of a desired subset of data in sharded clusters and saves you extra costs on data storage and transfer. This is the tech preview feature due to some [known limitations](../features/selective-backup.md#known-limitations).
* Benefit from up to 19 times faster physical restore performance with the support of [parallel download of data chunks from the S3 storage](../usage/restore.md#parallel-data-download).
* Improved deletion of old backups and point-in-time recovery oplog chunks simplifies the automation of backup storage cleanup.
* The improved handling of master keys for data at rest encryption in Percona Server for MongoDB and the retrieval of the key ID/secret path by PBM from a backup simplifies the environment preparation for the physical restore and improves the restore flow.
* The support of AWS tokens for the access to the S3 storage improves the security of your infrastructure and the integration with applications that interact with AWS resources via tokens.
