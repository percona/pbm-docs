# Percona Backup for MongoDB 2.5.0 (2024-05-16)

[Installation](../installation.md){.md-button}


Percona Backup for MongoDB is a distributed, low-impact solution for creating consistent backups of MongoDB sharded clusters and replica sets, and for restoring those backups to a specific point in time.

## Release Highlights

* You can now restore the desired subset of [custom databases with users and roles](../features/selective-backup.md#restore-a-database-with-users-and-roles) created in them. This is useful for deployments where each user has an individual database and authenticates against it.
* Previous versions of PBM required that `readConcern` and `writeConcern` are set to `majority` in MongoDB. You can now explicitly override this behavior, and thus, ensure backups in clusters configured to operate without the majority or lost it for some reason.


## New Features

* [PBM-1159](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PBM-1159) - Make ReadConcern configurable
* [PBM-799](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PBM-799) - Make WriteConcern configurable
* [PBM-1213](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PBM-1213) - Restore users and roles in custom databases during a selective restore

## Bugs Fixed

* [PBM-1257](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PBM-1257) - Fixed the issue with PBM failing on running the `pbm describe-backup` command.

* [PBM-1258](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PBM-1258) - Improved the resync from storage logic to be triggered only upon changes in the configuration file.
