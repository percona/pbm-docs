{{pbm.full_name}} is a distributed, low-impact solution for creating consistent backups of MongoDB sharded clusters and replica sets, and for restoring those backups to a specific point in time.

This is a hot-fix release to version 2.9.0. If you're running a mixed deployment with MongoDB Community and Percona Server for MongoDB, this update may help you in running physical backup and restores.
