# Percona Backup for MongoDB 2.8.0 ({{date.2_8_0}})

[Installation](../installation.md){.md-button}


Percona Backup for MongoDB is a distributed, low-impact solution for creating consistent backups of MongoDB sharded clusters and replica sets, and for restoring those backups to a specific point in time.

## Release Highlights

This release provides the following features and improvements:

## Better organization of selective backups

Now you can define multiple namespaces not only for selective restores but also for selective backups. This way you can better organize your backups as you accumulate the required data under a single backup. See how to make a backup of several namespaces in the [tutorial](../usage/backup-selective.md).

## Network routing control in communication of pbm-agents with the backup storage

You can now control how pbm-agents reach the same remote backup storage by defining custom endpoints for them. This way you respect the network settings of the data centers where the servers running  pbm-agents reside and ensure the proper functioning of PBM. Custom endpoints are supported for AWS and Microsoft Azure Blob storages. Learn more about the endpoint definition in the [documentation](../details/s3-storage.md#support-for-multiple-endpoints-to-the-same-s3-storage)

## Simplified troubleshooting with restoring the same collection under a different name

Now you can restore a single collection under a different name up to a certain point in time alongside the current collection. The restored collection has the same data and indexes as the one you backed up. This makes it easier to compare the data in both collections and identify what caused the issue with the database. As a result, your troubleshooting efforts significantly reduce.

To learn more about this functionality, refer to the [Restore a collection under a different name](../features/selective-backup.md#restore-a-collection-under-a-different-name) section in the documentation

## Reduced troubleshooting time with diagnostics report

Collect all information required to troubleshoot backups and restores in one go. Generate the comprehensive diagnostics report about an operation execution and either dive deep yourself or file a bug report to our experts and attach  the diagnostics archive to it. This way you reduce the iteration time and speed up the issue resolution.

Check the [Diagnostics report](../troubleshoot/pbm-report.md) for more details.

## Improved log rotation with a custom path for log output

You can now output logging information from every `pbm-agent` to a file at a custom path. This way you can introduce log rotation, manage the system log effectively and comply to security regulations for logging and auditing. 

Learn more about how to configure custom log path in the [documentation](../manage/logpath.md)

## Additional flexibility for backups

PBM no longer uses mongodump for making backups but uses its own dump implementation. This makes backup operations flexible as it lifts the mongodumps' limitations and opens space for further improvements. 

## Changes in supported MongoDB versions

Starting from this release, PBM supports Percona Server for MongoDB 8.0 and MongoDB Community 8.0. 

At the same time, PBM no longer supports Percona Server for MongoDB 5.0 and MongoDB Community 5.0 as it entered the end-of-life stage. Existing functionality remains compatible with version 5.0. However, we will no longer test new features and improvements against this version.

## Known limitation

Selective backups and restores fail for setups with config shards. Find more details in [PBM-1465](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PBM-1465).
