# Percona Backup for MongoDB 2.0.1 (2022-10-12)

| Release date | October 12, 2022  |
|------------- | ---------------|
| Installation | [Installing Percona Backup for MongoDB](../installation.md) |


Percona Backup for MongoDB is a distributed, low-impact solution for consistent backups of MongoDB sharded clusters and replica sets. This is a tool for creating consistent backups across a MongoDB sharded cluster (or a non-sharded replica set), and for restoring those backups to a specific point in time.

## Release Highlights

* The support of [server-side encryption with customer-provided keys managed on the customer side (SSE-C)](../details/storage-configuration.md#server-side-encryption) enables you to use the S3-compatible storage of your choice thus preventing the vendor lock-in and saving your costs on AWS KMS (Key Management Service).
* The ability to [configure Percona Backup for MongoDB remotely](../manage/configure-remotely.md) simplifies its management when PBM is deployed in Docker, Kubernetes or other cloud services. 
* The ability to configure the sidecar mode for Percona Backup for MongoDB improves its operation as part of [Kubernetes Operator for MongoDB](https://docs.percona.com/percona-operator-for-mongodb/index.html).
* Troubleshooting enhancements:
  
    - The ability to [define a timezone for logs and to follow the logs dynamically](../reference/pbm-commands.md#pbm-logs).
    - Indication of arbiter nodes as non-supported ones in `pbm status` output
