# Percona Backup for MongoDB 2.0.4 (2023-02-21)

| Release date | February 21, 2023  |
|------------- | ---------------|
| Installation | [Installing Percona Backup for MongoDB](../installation.md) |


Percona Backup for MongoDB is a distributed, low-impact solution for consistent backups of MongoDB sharded clusters and replica sets. This is a tool for creating consistent backups across a MongoDB sharded cluster (or a non-sharded replica set), and for restoring those backups to a specific point in time.

## Release Highlights

The ability to [specify the custom path to `mongod` binaries](../usage/restore#define-mongod-binary-location) simplifies the physical restore process.


## Bugs Fixed

* [PBM-1042](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PBM-1042) - Fixed the physical restore flow with the ability to set the custom path to `mongod` binaries
* [PBM-1047](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PBM-1047) - Fixed the issue with physical restore failure in a new environment.
