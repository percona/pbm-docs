# Percona Backup for MongoDB 1.0.0

Percona is happy to announce the GA release of our latest software product
Percona Backup for MongoDB 1.8 on September 19, 2019.

Percona Backup for MongoDB is a distributed, low-impact solution for consistent backups of MongoDB
sharded clusters and replica sets. This is a tool for creating consistent
backups across a MongoDB sharded cluster (or a single replica set), and for
restoring those backups to a specific point in time. The project was inspired by
(and intends to replace) the Percona-Lab/mongodb_consistent_backup tool.

Percona Backup for MongoDB supports [Percona Server for MongoDB](https://www.percona.com/software/mongo-database/percona-server-for-mongodb)
or [MongoDB Community Server](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/community) version 3.6 or higher with
[MongoDB replication](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/replication/)
enabled. Binaries for the supported platforms as well as the tarball with source
code are available from the [Percona Backup for MongoDB download page](https://www.percona.com/downloads/percona-backup-mongodb/). For more
information about Percona Backup for MongoDB and the installation steps, see the documentation.

Percona Backup for MongoDB 1.0.0 features the following:

* The architecture and the authentication of Percona Backup for MongoDB have been simplified compared
to the previous release.

* Stores backup data on [Amazon Simple Storage Service](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) or compatible storages, such as [MinIO](https://min.io/).

* The output of **pbm list** shows all backups created from the connected MongoDB
sharded cluster or replica set.
