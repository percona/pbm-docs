# Percona Backup for MongoDB 2.4.1 (2024-03-25)

[Installation](../installation.md){.md-button}


Percona Backup for MongoDB is a distributed, low-impact solution for consistent backups of MongoDB sharded clusters and replica sets. This is a tool for creating consistent backups across a MongoDB sharded cluster (or a non-sharded replica set), and for restoring those backups to a specific point in time.

## Release Highlights

This release fixes the issue with failing incremental backups. It was caused by the backup metadata document reaching the maximum size limit of 16MB. The issue is fixed by introducing the new approach of handling the metadatada document: it no longer contains the list of backup files which is now stored separately on the storage and is read by PBM on demand. The new metadata handling approach applies to physical, incremental and shapshot-based backups.
