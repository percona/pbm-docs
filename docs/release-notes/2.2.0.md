# Percona Backup for MongoDB 2.2.0 (2023-07-13)

| Release date | July 13, 2023  |
|------------- | ---------------|
| Installation | [Installing Percona Backup for MongoDB](../installation.md) |


Percona Backup for MongoDB is a distributed, low-impact solution for consistent backups of MongoDB sharded clusters and replica sets. This is a tool for creating consistent backups across a MongoDB sharded cluster (or a non-sharded replica set), and for restoring those backups to a specific point in time.

## Release Highlights

* [Point-in-time recovery from physical backups](../usage/pitr-physical.md) is now automated similar to point-in-time recovery from logical ones. This offloads your DBAs on performing manual oplog replay on top of physical restore, ensures data consistency and unifies the user experience with PBM.  
* Owners of large data sets can now use PBM to [create external physical backups](../features/snapshots.md) as EBS snapshots or via a technology of their choice and restore from those backups with the data consistency guaranteed by PBM. Thereby they benefit from increased performance and reduced downtime, and are sure that their data remains consistent. This is the technical preview feature.
* The ability to [restore from physical and incremental backups to a new environment](../features/restore-new-env.md) with different replica set names extends the set of compatible environments for physical restore. 

## New Features

* [PBM-952](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PBM-952) - Add ability to make external backups
* [PBM-815](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PBM-815) - Automated point-in-time recovery for physical backups

* [PBM-1118](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PBM-1118) - Support custom shard names for restores with replica set remapping
* [PBM-1132](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PBM-1132) - Disallow using the `--ns` flag for physical and incremental backups and restores
* [PBM-1133](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PBM-1133) - Add support for virtual-hostedâ€“style URL for s3 storage buckets
