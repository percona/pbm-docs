# Percona Backup for MongoDB 2.4.0 (2024-02-29)

[Installation](../installation.md){.md-button}


Percona Backup for MongoDB is a distributed, low-impact solution for consistent backups of MongoDB sharded clusters and replica sets. This is a tool for creating consistent backups across a MongoDB sharded cluster (or a non-sharded replica set), and for restoring those backups to a specific point in time.

## Release Highlights

* You can now delete backup snapshots of a specific type. This helps you better meet the organization's policy and implement the backup strategy.
* Point-in-time recovery oplog slicing is now running in parallel with backup snapshots. This ensures that you can make a [point-in-time recovery](../pitr-tutorial.md) to any timestamp from very large backups that take hours to make.
* Percona Backup for MongoDB packages are available for ARM64 architectures, enabling users to install it on premises. The ARM64 packages are available for the following operating systems:

    * Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal Fossa)   
    * Ubuntu 22.04 (Jammy Jellyfish)
    * Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 and compatible derivatives
    * Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 and compatible derivatives
