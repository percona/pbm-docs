# Percona Backup for MongoDB 2.4.0 (2024-03-05)

[Installation](../installation.md){.md-button}


Percona Backup for MongoDB is a distributed, low-impact solution for consistent backups of MongoDB sharded clusters and replica sets. This is a tool for creating consistent backups across a MongoDB sharded cluster (or a non-sharded replica set), and for restoring those backups to a specific point in time.

## Release Highlights

* You can now [delete backup snapshots of a specific type](../usage/delete-backup.md#__tabbed_2_3). For example, delete only logical backups which you might have created and no longer need. You can also check what exactly will be deleted with the new `--dry-run flag`. This improvement helps you better meet the organization's backup policy and improves your experience with cleaning up outdated data.
* Point-in-time recovery oplog slicing is now running in parallel with backup snapshots. This ensures that you can make a [point-in-time recovery](../usage/pitr-tutorial.md) to any timestamp from very large backups that take hours to make.
* Percona Backup for MongoDB packages are now also available for ARM64 architectures. Thus, users can not only run Percona Backup for MongoDB in Docker containers on ARM-based workstations but also install the packages on those workstations. The ARM64 packages are available for the following operating systems:

    * Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal Fossa)   
    * Ubuntu 22.04 (Jammy Jellyfish)
    * Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 and compatible derivatives
    * Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 and compatible derivatives
