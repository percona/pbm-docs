# Percona Backup for MongoDB 2.7.0 ({{date.2_7_0}})

[Installation](../installation.md){.md-button}


Percona Backup for MongoDB is a distributed, low-impact solution for creating consistent backups of MongoDB sharded clusters and replica sets, and for restoring those backups to a specific point in time.

## Release Highlights

This release primarily focuses on code stability and bug fixing. However, it also provides the following improvement:

### Single authentication point for PBM running in Amazon EKS

Now PBM running in Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) can access AWS services using the credentials from the IAM role associated with the service account that is assigned to the Pod where PBM is running. Since with this improvement you don't have to pass the credentials to every individual Pods, the overall security of your infrastructure increases.
