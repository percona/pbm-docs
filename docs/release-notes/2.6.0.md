# Percona Backup for MongoDB 2.6.0 ({{date.2_6_0}})

[Installation](../installation.md){.md-button}


Percona Backup for MongoDB is a distributed, low-impact solution for creating consistent backups of MongoDB sharded clusters and replica sets, and for restoring those backups to a specific point in time.

## Release Highlights

This release provides the following features and improvements:

### Multiple storages for backups and restores

You can now define multiple storages for making backups and instruct PBM on what storage to save a backup: on the main or on any additional (external) one. This ability helps you save on data transfer costs when using cloud storage, as well as enables you to follow closely with the requirements of your organizationâ€™s backup policy.

To learn more, read [Multiple storages for backups](../features/multi-storage.md
).

### Adjust node priority for point-in-time recovery oplog slicing

You can now redefine node priorities not only for making backups but also for point-in-time recovery oplog slices. For example, you can instruct PBM to save oplog slices either from a dedicated node or from nodes in the geographically closest location, thus reducing network latency. 

See the [Adjust node priority for oplog slices](../usage/pitr-tutorial.md#adjust-node-priority-for-oplog-slices) section for guidelines.

### Additional control over PBM command execution

You can now configure the waiting time for a command execution by passing the `--wait-time` flag for the following commands:

* pbm config --force-resync --wait --wait-time="5m"
* pbm backup --wait --wait-time="5m"
* pbm restore --wait --wait-time="5m"
* pbm oplog-replay --wait --wait-time="5m"
* pbm profile add --sync --wait --wait-time="5m"
* pbm profile remove --wait --wait-time="5m"
* pbm profile sync --wait --wait-time="5m"
* pbm delete-pitr --older-than --wait --wait-time="5m"
* pbm cleanup --older-than --wait --wait-time="5m"

This way you have more control over the PBM operation. This enhancement also improves the error logging.

### Snapshot-based physical backups are generally available

With snapshot-based physical backups now generally available, you can use this functionality in production environments and enjoy all the benefits of faster restores from snapshots with almost immediate access to data. 

### Dropped support of MongoDB 4.4

Percona Backup for MongoDB drops support of MongoDB 4.4. Existing functionality in Percona Backup for MongoDB remains compatible with MongoDB 4.4 and Percona Server for MongoDB 4.4; however, further enhancements and bug fixes are no longer tested against this version.

### Packaging Changes

* Percona Backup for MongoDB is available on Ubuntu 24.04 (Noble Numbat).
* Percona Backup for MongoDB is no longer supported for Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic Beaver), Debian 10 and Red Hat Enterprise 7 and derivatives as these operating systems reached End-Of-Life.

* [PBM-1341](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PBM-1341) - Fixed the issue with failing physical restore on a node shutdown stage by retrying the shutdown operation.

* [PBM-1343](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PBM-1343) - Fixed the issue with `pbm-agent` not being able to start oplog slicing by releasing the lock before exiting the function to allow pbm-agent on another node to continue the slicing. (Thanks to Tomasz Spyrka for reporting the issue and contribution)

* [PBM-1344](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PBM-1344) - Continue PITR oplog slicing from a fresh full backup if PBM cannot catch up with old oplog slices on the storage.
