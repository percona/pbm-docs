# Percona Backup for MongoDB 2.13.0 ({{date.2_13_0}})

[Installation](../installation.md){.md-button}


Percona Backup for MongoDB (PBM) is a distributed, low-impact solution for creating consistent backups of MongoDB sharded clusters and replica sets, and for restoring those backups to a specific point in time.

## Release Highlights

=== "🛡️ Workload Identity Federation (WIF)"
     ## Secure GCS Backups with Workload Identity Federation (WIF)for PBM
     Percona Backup for MongoDB (PBM) 2.13.0 now supports Workload Identity Federation (WIF) for authenticating with Google Cloud Storage (GCS).

This feature enables secure backup uploads without relying on static service account JSON keys. Instead, PBM uses short-lived, automatically refreshed tokens obtained through federation with an external identity provider (IdP). 

Workload Identity Federation lets on-premises or multicloud workloads access Google Cloud resources using federated identities instead of a service account key, eliminating the maintenance and security burden of service account keys.

To dive deep into this feature, refer to our comprehensive [documentation](https://docs.percona.com/percona-backup-mongodb/details/workload-identity-auth.html).

=== " 🔐 Selective backups"
    ### Support for selective backup with users and roles

    Percona Backup for MongoDB allows you to create selective backups of databases and collections, including the users and roles defined within the database. This ensures that access control is restored along with the data.

    To back up a specific namespace and include users and roles:

    ```bash
    pbm backup --ns="mydb.*" --with-users-and-roles
    ```

    For more information, see our [documentation](https://docs.percona.com/percona-backup-mongodb/usage/backup-selective.html#selective-backup-with-users-and-roles)
